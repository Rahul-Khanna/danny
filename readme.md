### D(ictionary-based) A(pproximate) N(earest) (N)eighbor Y(up)

In general danny should be used when O(|E|) << O(|U|*|V|), where E is the set of all edges, U is the set of all user nodes, V is the set of all entity nodes in the bipartite user-entity graph. This generally means the degree of each user vertrex is much smaller than |V| and the degree of each entity vertrex is much smaller than |U|
